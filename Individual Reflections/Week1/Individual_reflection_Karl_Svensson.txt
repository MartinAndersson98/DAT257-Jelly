WEEK 36:

	The feeling so far is good, we have a social contract ind three KPI's.
	We have decided to try out UNITY to create a game, since I haven't used it previously my main learning o	objective is to understand and use the UNITY tool. My plan is to use the included tutorial and also look 	online for good tutorials. Other objectives is to understand and learn to apply Scrum to our project. I 	will learn this by attending to lectures. 

	I can help by sharing the knowledge I've gained when trying to learn UNITY, hopefully we can learn it 		together, and members that already knows how to use UNITY can help others. We can create a plan together 	so that everyone gets a basic knowledge.

	The feeling in the group is good, everyone is friendly and the social contract creates a good group 		dynamic.
